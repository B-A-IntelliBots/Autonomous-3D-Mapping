# Robot Design – CATIA Parts

This Folder contains all the **CATIA (.CATPart)** files for the design of my mobile robot.
---

## 🛠️ Design Overview
The robot design includes:
- **Chassis** – Structural base of the robot.  
- **Camera & Servo Motor Holders** – Dedicated mounts for precise sensor and actuator placement.  
- **Electrical Component Distribution** – Organized layout that ensures balanced weight and shifts the **center of mass** toward the middle of the robot for improved stability.  
- **Pillar Holders** – Supporting structures that enhance robustness and modular assembly.

## 📂 File Content
- `.CATPart` files of the designed components.
- `FULL_ROBOT_DESIGN.CATProduct` is the complete assembly-ready structure for the robot’s main body and accessory mounts.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
Special thanks to [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/) for facilitating the design process.  
Some electrical components used in this project were sourced from GrabCAD, where they were provided in **.CATPart** format.

## 📌 Notes
- The design can be adapted for different robot platforms depending on size and functional requirements.  
- All files are compatible with **CATIA V5** (and later versions).
